Monthly maintenance checklist
Weekly tasks (15-30 minutes/week)
1. Monitor system health
Check Inngest dashboard for failed jobs
Review Sentry for errors
Check Evolution API logs for issues
Verify WhatsApp connections are active
2. Check resource usage
VPS CPU/RAM usage (should be <80%)
Database size (Supabase free tier: 500MB limit)
Bandwidth usage
Google AI API quota usage
3. Review failed jobs
Check failed_jobs table in database
Retry or investigate failures
Fix any recurring issues
Monthly tasks (1-2 hours/month)
1. Evolution API updates
# SSH into VPSssh user@your-vps-ip# Update Evolution APIcd evolution-apigit pulldocker-compose pulldocker-compose up -d# Verify it's runningdocker-compose psdocker-compose logs api --tail 20
Time: 10-15 minutes
Frequency: Monthly (or when security updates are released)
2. Database maintenance
Backups:
Supabase: Automatic daily backups (free tier)
Evolution API: Manual backup of PostgreSQL data
# Backup Evolution API databasedocker exec evolution_postgres pg_dump -U evolution_user evolution_api > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql# Store backup off-server (S3, Dropbox, etc.)
Database optimization:
Check for slow queries
Review table sizes
Clean up old data if needed (optional)
Time: 15-20 minutes
Frequency: Monthly
3. Security updates
VPS system updates:
ssh user@your-vps-ipapt update && apt upgrade -y# Restart if kernel updatedreboot
Docker updates:
docker-compose pulldocker-compose up -d
Dependency updates (My Aibud):
cd my-aibudnpm auditnpm update  # Review changelogs firstnpm run build  # Test before deploying
Time: 20-30 minutes
Frequency: Monthly (or when security alerts)
4. Cost review
Check monthly bills:
VPS hosting (Hetzner: €6-12/month)
Supabase (free tier or paid)
Google AI API usage
Vercel (free tier usually sufficient)
Domain renewal (annual)
Optimize if needed:
Review unused resources
Check for unexpected charges
Consider scaling up/down
Time: 10 minutes
Frequency: Monthly
5. Monitoring setup review
Verify alerts are working:
Sentry error alerts
Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Better Uptime)
Inngest function failures
Database connection issues
Time: 10 minutes
Frequency: Monthly
6. Client support review
Check for issues:
Review support tickets/emails
Check client usage patterns
Identify common problems
Update documentation if needed
Time: 30-60 minutes
Frequency: Monthly (or as needed)
Quarterly tasks (2-3 hours/quarter)
1. Major updates
Evolution API major version updates
Next.js framework updates
Database migrations (if schema changes)
Review and update dependencies
Time: 1-2 hours
Frequency: Quarterly
2. Performance review
Analyze response times
Review database query performance
Check for bottlenecks
Optimize slow queries
Time: 1 hour
Frequency: Quarterly
3. Security audit
Review access logs
Check for suspicious activity
Rotate API keys (if needed)
Review firewall rules
Update SSL certificates (auto-renewed, but verify)
Time: 30-60 minutes
Frequency: Quarterly
Automated tasks (no manual work)
Already automated:
SSL certificate renewal (Let's Encrypt auto-renews)
Database backups (Supabase automatic)
Error tracking (Sentry sends alerts)
Uptime monitoring (external service)
Inngest retries (automatic)
Vercel deployments (auto-deploys on git push)
Time estimate summary
Task	Frequency	Time/Month
Weekly monitoring	4x/month	1-2 hours
Evolution API updates	Monthly	15 min
Database maintenance	Monthly	20 min
Security updates	Monthly	30 min
Cost review	Monthly	10 min
Monitoring review	Monthly	10 min
Client support	Monthly	30-60 min
Quarterly tasks	1x/3 months	2-3 hours
Total monthly time: ~3-5 hours/month
Minimal maintenance setup
If you automate monitoring:
Daily (automated):
Sentry sends error alerts
Uptime monitoring alerts on downtime
Inngest dashboard shows failures
Weekly (5 minutes):
Quick check of Sentry dashboard
Review Inngest failed jobs
Check VPS resource usage
Monthly (1 hour):
Update Evolution API
Review costs
Check database size
Security updates
Total: ~1-2 hours/month with automation
Tools to reduce maintenance
1. Monitoring services (free/cheap):
UptimeRobot (free: 50 monitors)
Better Uptime (free tier)
Sentry (free tier: 5k events/month)
2. Automated backups:
Supabase: Automatic
Evolution API: Cron job for daily backups
Store in S3/Cloudflare R2 ($0.015/GB)
3. Auto-scaling:
VPS auto-scaling scripts (when CPU >80%)
Database auto-scaling (Supabase handles this)
4. CI/CD:
GitHub Actions (already set up)
Auto-deploy on git push
Run tests before deploy
What breaks if you skip maintenance
Low risk (can wait):
Minor Evolution API updates (security patches are important)
Dependency updates (unless security-related)
Performance optimization
High risk (do not skip):
Security updates (VPS, Docker, system)
Database backups (data loss risk)
Monitoring alerts (miss critical issues)
SSL certificate renewal (auto, but verify)
Recommended maintenance schedule
Week 1: System updates + security patches
Week 2: Database review + backups
Week 3: Cost review + optimization
Week 4: Performance review + client support
Daily: Check alerts (5 minutes)
Weekly: Quick health check (10 minutes)
Monthly: Full maintenance (1-2 hours)
Bottom line
With proper setup:
Monthly time: 1-2 hours
Most tasks are automated
Focus on monitoring and updates
Minimal manual intervention
Without automation:
Monthly time: 3-5 hours
More manual checks needed
Higher risk of missing issues
Recommendation: Set up monitoring alerts (Sentry, UptimeRobot) to reduce manual checks to ~1 hour/month.
